# MyLinkedList Problem


Introduction:

In this project you will add methods to an existing linked list class.


Description:

Modify the author's "MyLinkedList" class to add the following methods:
  
   a.  swap
        receives two index positions as parameters, and swaps the values at
        these positions, provided both positions are within the current size

   b.  reverse
        returns a new MyLinkedList that has the elements in reverse order.

   c.  erase 
        receives an index position and number of elements as parameters, and
        removes elements beginning at the index position for the number of 
        elements specified, provided the index position is within the size
        and together with the number of elements does not exceed the size

   d.  insertList
        receives a List and an index position as parameters, and copies all of the 
        passed list into the existing list at the position specified by the parameter,
        provided the index position does not exceed the size

   e.  main
        add code to the main method to demonstrate each of your methods
