# Problem Description

Write a class called "Square".  It should store the length of one side. It should have two constructors, one that has no parameters and sets the side length to one. 

The other constructor should take one parameter and set the side length to the parameter value.  The class should also have a method call "getArea" that returns the area of the square.

Write a separate class called "TestSquare" that creates two squares, one with each constructor, and prints the area of each.
