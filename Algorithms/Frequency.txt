# Problem Description

Write a class called "Frequency".  Its main method should use a Scanner to input an integer and a string. The integer and string should be evaluated to print a frequency range abbreviation according to this table:  http://www.qsl.net/w2va/freq.htm

For example, if the user enters 100 KHz, your program should write LF.

For inputs outside the ranges in the table, just print Unknown. Integers can be compared with the == operator, but strings are compared with the equals method.  For example, a == b, if a and b are integers, or a.equals(b), if a and b are strings.
